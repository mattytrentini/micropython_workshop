  * A laptop with Linux, Mac OS or Windows and at least one free USB port.
  * If it's Windows or Mac OS, make sure to install `drivers`_ for the CP2102 UBS2TTL chip. MacOS El Capitan requires `disabling kext signing`_ to install it.

  * You will need a terminal application installed. For Linux and Mac you can
    use ``screen``, which is installed by default. For Windows we recommend `PuTTy`_
  * Please note that the workshop will be in English.
