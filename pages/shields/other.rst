Other Shields
*************

There are a number of other shields that are not yet integrated into the
workshop documentation but may be encountered.

Ambient Light
=============

The `Ambient Light Sensor Shield`_ uses a `BH1750`_ chip to detect the amount
of ambient light present. It uses :ref:`I2C` to communicate with the
microcontroller.

IR controller
=============

The `IR Controller`_ has four infrared emitters and a receiver to allow
bi-directional infrared communications. Two GPIO pins are used to send and
receive data.

Temperature Sensor (SHT30)
==========================

There are a number of temperature sensors but one of the more common models in
the Wemos form factor is the `SHT30 Shield`_. Named after the `SHT30`_
temperature and humidity sensor it uses :ref:`I2C` to communicate with the
microcontroller.
